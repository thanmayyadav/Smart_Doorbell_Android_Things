# smart-doorbell
a project demonstrating an Android Things use case...

This project demonstrates an use case of Android Things without the Rainbow HAT, which is not included in the GDG Android Things Developer Kit package.
Thanks to Rafael Miranda (https://github.com/raeglan) from GDG Bremen who wrote the original project in Java (https://github.com/raeglan/SmartDoorbell). This is a simplified fork of his code.
